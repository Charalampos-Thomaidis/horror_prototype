# Horror_prototype
A horror game prototype made in unity engine.

Has 2 scenes the main menu and the trial. On main menu you can change quality settings , resolution , fps limit, fullscreen mode, audio valume and you can also check the controlls of the game (keybinds). 
Trial is simple it's just escape the place, the player controller, inventory and can interact with various interactables
there is 1 simple puzzle only and 1 enemy. Enemy has the states of: Patrol, Chase, Search, Flinch.
For the most part it's working but still on progress and has few logic errors which cause some small bugs but not gamebreaking.
